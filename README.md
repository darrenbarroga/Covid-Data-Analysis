# COVID-19 Death Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 death data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis is performed using MySQL for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset used includes global COVID-19 death records, and various analyses are conducted to understand the impact of the pandemic over time and across different regions.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this project is sourced from Our World In Data:
- [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Installation
To replicate this analysis, you need the following software installed on your machine:
- MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Server
- Python (optional, for data cleaning and preprocessing)
- Excel (optional, for initial data cleaning)

### MySQL Setup
1. Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a new database in MySQL Workbench.
3. Import the cleaned CSV file into the database using the MySQL Workbench Import Wizard.

### Python Setup (Optional)
If you want to perform data cleaning using Python, install the necessary libraries:
```sh pip install pandas```

## Visualizations
To visualize the analysis results, you can use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or any other visualization software. Here are some suggested visualizations:

1. Total Deaths by Country: A bar chart showing the total number of deaths reported in each country.
2. Monthly Death Trend: A line chart depicting the trend of COVID-19 deaths over months globally.
3. Deaths Distribution: A pie chart showing the distribution of deaths across different regions.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of COVID-19 deaths to help understand the pandemic's impact globally. The insights drawn from this analysis can aid in policy-making, healthcare planning, and resource allocation.
